                            <br/><h3>The goal</h3><br/>
                        <p>
                            We wanted to addres the problem of how women are being patronized by many male rappers, and that words
                            as <i>whore</i> and <i>bitch</i> are way too common in hip-hop lyrics. This problem then continues, as 
                            young people listen to this music. We weren't interested in the solution of just boycutting this music, as 
                            we all like the genre ourself. We took a different approach. 
                        </p>
                        <br/><h3>The final project</h3><br/>
                        <p>
                            What we made was a program written in p5.js - a JavaScript library. The program loops through song lyrics
                            (stored in a JSON-file) 
                            and identifies female pronouns and exchange them with male ones. The new edited lyric then gets displayed 
                            on the screen and automatically refreshes and does it with a new lyric. You can see an example of this 
                            exchange in the picture above. 
                        </p>
                        <br/><h3><b>What did we learn from this?</b></h3><br/>
                        <p>
                            Besides the obvious parts as practicing coding, especially using a JSON-file was new to us, and becoming more 
                            experienced with JavaScript, I really enjoyed how we were able too express critique through coding. I really 
                            think this program speaks for itself, and that it is not necessary to explain why it is critical and how for 
                            visitors to know. <br/>
                            Making this program in a studygroup, we shared responsibilities and made the program faster and better than 
                            any of us could have done by themselves. 
                        </p>
                        <br/><h3>Overall I gained more experienced with:</h3><br/>
