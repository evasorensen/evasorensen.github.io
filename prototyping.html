                                <span class="image right"><img src="images/miro.png" alt="" /></span>
                                We started a miro-board to give an overlook about what elements we needed to make in our game: starting 
                                page, two games, score page, profilpage and more. All of these things, we needed to prototype. <br/>
                                We all did a prototype for the interface - like starting- and homepage - and came together with these 
                                prototypes to figure out what would work best for our target-group. After this, we quickly started 
                                making some paper prototyping and settled on the structure of the game. We agreed
                                on some global standards for our interface - ex.: colors, fonts, outlines and elements - 
                                and now we continued making one prototype that would show how every page of the game should look 
                                like. We also agreed on two "minigames" to code, so that we can showcase these at the Design Expo. <br/><br/>
                                The methods and digital tools we've used for prototyping is: 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Figma</li>
                                    <li>Miro</li>
                                    <li>Paper</li>
                                    <li>Visual Code Studios: JavaScript, HTML and CSS</li>
                                </ul>
                                There are different advantages for each of these tools. As example, we were quick to find some paper 
                                to illustrate and communicate our individual thoughts. We then would move over to prototyping in 
                                Figma to get a higher fidelity and a possibility to do iterative prototyping. We also wanted to code 
                                as much of the two minigames as possible, and wrote this in JavaScript. Before coding them, the concept 
                                and look of it was prototyped in Figma as well. This took more time, but on the other hand we can get 
                                exactly the visual and interaction we wanted in the games.
