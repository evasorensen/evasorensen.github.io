                                Screenshot of the website <a href="boernetelefonen.dk">boernetelefonen.dk</a>, where children 
                                can write letters and then both professionals and other children can answer and support. 
                                The website also consists guides and general information about bullying. We've used this 
                                website for our qualitative deskresearch.

                                <h3>Deskresearch</h3>
                                In the beginning of our project after we chose the topic of children and bullying we began doing 
                                deskresearch about the topic. We were in doubt as to how we could do a research about this sensitive 
                                topic without including children. After discussing this problem with our fellow students and among
                                ourselves we found that we could make a pretty good research only researching the internet for 
                                informations upon the topic. And as hopes, we quickly found information - both statistics and 
                                qualitative data as example the letters from children at boernetelefonen.dk. In this way, we could 
                                avoid involving children to extract information from them in an ethnographic research, as it would put them in an uncomftable 
                                situation were they would have to upen up to us about this topic. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <u>Our most important findings included the following:</u> 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Children in our target group <b>have experienced bullying</b></li>
                                    <li>The amount of bullying children experience is as much online as it is offline</li>
                                    <li>We found several examples where involving parents, teacher, or both did not help
                                        the problem</li>
                                    <li>Children who writes about having problems with bullying are <b>all genders</b>, not either
                                        boys or girls</li>
                                    <li>For 13 years olds 13% of girls and 8% of boys have experienced <b>online bullying</b></li>
                                    <li>As children within our target-group gets older, the less they trust their teachers 
                                        (they then tend to talk to their closest friends, if they have any)</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What we take with us from the research is that bullying in our target group is in fact a problem. 
                                Even though there are many initiatives trying to prevent or stop it, it doesn't always help. This 
                                results in some children having to switch schools, this leads to an unsteady childhood that will 
                                have an impact on the individual as an adult. <br/>We also got aware to the gender-issue many 
                                children are struggeling with in their early teens. This is also often the reason for them being
                                bullied.
