								<h1>A site-specific audio drama</h1>
								<p>
									This collaborative audiodrama was made for the exam in the couse of "Site-specific audio drama". I 
									chose this course to obtain more knowledge of how to use and create sounds that can amplify a 
									mood, and accommodate specific feelings.

							<h3>What we made</h3><br/>
							<p>
								Working together in a group, we were given a specific place in Aarhus from where we had to make our 
								5 min audiodrama - there were no other requirements than this. We made a fun and somewhat cringe 
								drama about a woman and a man who meets up for a blind date, that quickly goes wrong. 
							</p>
							<br/><h3>How we made it</h3><br/>
							<p>
								We made the audiodrama in Reaper (a program to record sound and edit). We had the pleasure of the help 
								from two actors who recorded our script. <br/>What we focused on in our story was reflecting the 
								contrast of the place in the two people who where in our story and how they clashed. This was 
								intensified by the background noises that was both related to nature and the noisy big city, again 
								representing the two very different characters. 
							</p>
							<br/><h3>Overall I gained more experienced with:</h3><br/>
							<ul>
								<li>Sound: effects, moods, and techniques</li>
								<li>Reaper</li>
								<li>Storytelling</li>
							</ul>
							<hr/>
							<p>
								NB: The audio-drama is sadly not accessible to me anymore, and therefore it is not possible for me 
								to present it here.
